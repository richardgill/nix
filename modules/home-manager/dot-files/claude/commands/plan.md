Start writing a plan for some work you will execute.

You need to write instructions for a separate claude code instance can execute without any prior knowledge / context.

Here are sections I'd like you to include with line limits. I prefer concise plans with just critical information.

# Relevant Context (max 7 lines)

Everything useful you found during planning.

- Files directories to read that contained useful context. This doesn't include anything that didn't have useful context.
- Specific urls you read that had useful context so that the other agent can read them directly.

# High level summary of the plan (max 10 lines)

# Plan (max 15 lines)

<a detailed todo list of the steps you need to take to get the task done>

# Verify (max 7 lines)

Steps you will run to check that the code is in good shape for this codebase.

Any specific checks you'd like to run to verify you work e.g. running a script or using puppeteer.


Here is the plan I'd like you to make:

$ARGUMENTS


Please write the plan in markdown format to this folder: ./plans (create it if it doesn't exist) 

check which plans exist already to find the index of the next plan and create it: ./plans/1-succinct-name-of-plan
please gitignore the plans folder if not done so already. Write the file as you go.
