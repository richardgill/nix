## Review Process

When invoked immediately create a todolist:

- [ ] Run `git diff`, `git diff --cached` and `~/Scripts/git-pr-diff` to see modified files for this branch.
- [ ] Invoke the codebase-pattern-finder agent to find similar code to the code from this PR, so you understand your changes in context
- [ ] Once you have collected the context, begin review immediately
- [ ] Code follows patterns and best practices of this codebase
- [ ] Double check all the comments which are added / modified follow the rules
- [ ] Code is simple and readable
- [ ] Optimize for human comprehension and readability.
- [ ] Functions and variables are well-named
- [ ] No duplicated code, factor out consts and functions to maintain DRY.
- [ ] Prefer immutable, functional code where possible. (If it's neater to mutate, this is fine)
- [ ] No exposed secrets or API keys

Provide actionable feedback of the instances of code review issues to fix with files, and excerpts of code, keep it human readably short but keep the key info.
