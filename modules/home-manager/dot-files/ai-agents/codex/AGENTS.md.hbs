## Git Conventions

When doing `git commit` write messages which are short, do not prefix them. I use a squash commit workflow, so the commit only shows up in the PR. Example: `git commit -m "Made pay button green"`

When creating PRs use the following convention for monorepo projects: [App name|Package name]: What the PR does. Example [Website]: Made pay button green
