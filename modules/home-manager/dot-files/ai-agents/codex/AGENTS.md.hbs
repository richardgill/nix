## TypeScript / JavaScript

- Always use `const myFunc = () => ...` in typescript.
- Use `export const` and only use `export default` if it's needed by a library or framework
- Always define functions at the root scope, do not nest function definitions in functions unless really you need to
- Use TypeScript `type` over `interface` unless you must use interface

## Git Conventions

When doing `git commit` write messages which are short, do not prefix them. I use a squash commit workflow, so the commit only shows up in the PR. Example: `git commit -m "Made pay button green"`

When creating PRs use the following convention for monorepo projects: [App name|Package name]: What the PR does. Example [Website]: Made pay button green
