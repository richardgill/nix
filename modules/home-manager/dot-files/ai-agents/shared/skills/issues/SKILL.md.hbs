  Manages the persistent file-based work tracker at thoughts/shared/issues/.
  Use when the user says: "what's next", "what should I work on", "show backlog",
  "track this", "create an issue", "add to backlog", "mark done", "close issue",
  "show tasks", "triage issues", "update status", "show roadmap", "priorities",

# Issue Management

Manage the project's persistent work tracker in `thoughts/shared/issues/`.

{{> issues-structure }}

## Commands

### List Active Issues
```bash
ls -1d thoughts/shared/issues/*/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v done/
```

### Show What's Next
```bash
ls -1d thoughts/shared/issues/*/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v done/ | head -1
```

### Create Issue

1. Check existing phases: `ls thoughts/shared/issues/`
2. Pick phase number (use gaps like 10, 20, 30 for flexibility)
3. Create folder:
   - Single issue: `thoughts/shared/issues/NN-issue-name/`
   - Multi-issue phase: `thoughts/shared/issues/NN-phase/issue-name/`
4. Add `plan.md` with scope and implementation details
5. Optionally add `design.md` for design notes

### Complete Issue

Move to done when fully implemented:
```bash
mkdir -p thoughts/shared/issues/done
mv thoughts/shared/issues/NN-issue-name thoughts/shared/issues/done/
```

### Show Progress
```bash
echo "Active:" && ls -1d thoughts/shared/issues/*/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v done/ | wc -l
echo "Done:" && ls -1d thoughts/shared/issues/done/*/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

### Triage/Prioritize

1. Review all phases: `ls -la thoughts/shared/issues/`
2. Check recent work to identify completed issues:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -20
   git diff main~10..main --stat
   ```
3. Move completed issues to done
4. Renumber folders to reorder priority
5. Move items between phases as needed
6. Update any `plan.md` files with new scope
