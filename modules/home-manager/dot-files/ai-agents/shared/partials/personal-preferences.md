I work on Mac or NixOS and the filesystem is case sensitive

Only do git commits when I explicitly ask.

Prefer not to use npx or bunx for anything where package.json has it. Rely on pnpm exec

There is a gitignored `scratch/` folder in all repos - you can use it for temporary work and experimentation.

You can `gh repo clone` helpful repos to `~/code/reference-repos/` and then explore them to figure out how things work.
