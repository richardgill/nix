# Code Style Guide

## Comments

- Pre-existing comments: Leave intact when editing code
- New comments: Do NOT add new comments unless it's a truly exceptional case / noteworthy

## TypeScript / JavaScript

- Always use `const myFunc = () => ...` in typescript.
- Use `export const` and only use `export default` if it's needed by a library or framework
- Always define functions at the root scope, do not nest function definitions in functions unless really you need to
- Always use TypeScript `type` in favor of `interface` unless you must use interface (or it follows conventions in the code)
- Favor `??` over `||` where it makes sense.
- Favor `Boolean(blah)` over `!!blah`
- Do not use: `while`, `switch`, `continue`, `break`, `in` keywords except if there is good reason to do so
- New comments: Always single line // comments
- Existing comments: Keep comment style that was there before
- Prefer immutable, functional code where possible. (If it's neater to mutate, this is fine)
