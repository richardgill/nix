For quick comprehension you must present code changes outside-in, showing new code / code changes **in context** with surrounding existing code:
You need to show me the code as a 'sketch' of the 'shape' of the code whilst being brief.

What to include:

- The high level 'story' of function calls and high-level control flow.
- Show the flow of the code as if I was reading the usages, so I can understand the structure that a first time reader of the code would see. But omit the
 technical details from the code, it's a sketch.
- I care about the functions (including signatures, put them as comments above the function usages). Use TypeScript imports at the top to show file paths, file status, and function status.
- Relevant code context around the changes so I can understand how our changes and additions fit into the existing code

What **not** to include:
- Internal implementation details that are obvious, by default omit the code inside of functions themselves unless it's important
- Too much information - you need to maximize comprehension so I can review the plan quickly
