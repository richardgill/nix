  This skill refines rough ideas into fully-formed designs through collaborative questioning
  and exploration. Triggers: "help me brainstorm", "let's think through", "explore options",
  "what are some approaches", "help me design", "think through this with me", "ideate on",
  "what are my options". Use before writing code or plans when the approach is unclear.
  Not for mechanical/routine tasks where the solution is already known.

# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

You can use the research-web skill to search the web

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible{{#if (eq agent "claude")}} using AskUserQuestion tool{{/if}}, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Use the Skill(issues) to write the validated design to `./issues/<path-to-issue>/design.md`

- Ask: "Want to create a plan or begin implementation?"
- Create detailed implementation plan in the same issue folder

## Key Principles

- {{> usage-signature-flow }}
{{> usage-signature-flow-impl-skippable }}
- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
