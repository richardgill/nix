# Creating Plans

## Overview

Write plans optimized for human review:

## Plan Document Structure

A plan has two sections:

### Plan summary for human review at the top

The summary tells a story that a human engineer can follow in <150 lines. You must show the *shape* of the changes so the plan reviewer can spot issues early. The goal of the plan is to help the human understand what the high level plan is without an overwhelming amount of information.

The plan summary may include the following:

- Reassert briefly your understanding of what the goal of the plan is (so that the human can verify that you understand)
- The information that you gathered that the human likely doesn't already know which impacted the direction of the plan
- The shape of the code after the plan is implemented, so they can verify the design is agreeable to them. Use the usage-signature-flow format below.
- Decisions you made (possibly implicitly) that have a valid (>40% chance of being valid) other options.
- Assumptions you made that could be incorrect (less than 85% certain)
- Automated strategy that an agent will use to check changes fulfill the goals of the plan. Keep them simple, they should be as e2e as possible. They could involve writing a script in scratch/ to invoke functionality into a verifiable string that an agent can review.

#### Usage signature flow

## Plan Summary

### Plan implementation details

```
## Plan implementation instructions

- Which files will be affected and how.
- Include all files to change with line numbers:
- The code that will go in that file
- Each step is one bite sized action (2-3 minutes)
- Structure your plan as a check list using [ ]
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")

Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD.

```

## Making your plan

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the creating-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

You must surface any genuine / important questions you have using multichoice questions.

- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible{{#if (eq agent "claude")}} using AskUserQuestion tool{{/if}}, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions

Start by creating a planning todo list:

Collect context information:

- [ ] Read any provided documents / context & Explore the relevant code
- [ ] Use the codebase-pattern-finder skill to identify similar code
- [ ] If you have questions or are unsure about anything please ask for clarification until everything is resolved

Draft the plan and iterate:

- [ ] Draft a full plan (summary + implementation) and write it to disk using the "issues skill" using the "issues skill"
- [ ] Read the plan again and review it based on the plan criteria laid out here. Focus on how easy it is for human to digest and review the plan so they can give feedback on any potential issues early on.{{#if (eq agent "claude")}} ultrathink on this step an iterate until you're happy with the plan.{{/if}}
{{#if (eq agent "claude")}}
- [ ] Run `sed -n '1,/^## Plan implementation/p' <plan-file> | head -n -1` to output the human-readable summary

**End with by replying to user with:**
```
You can also use: ctrl-o to see human readable plan verbatim
Would you like to create a worktree with worktree skill to start working on this issue?
/implement-plan ./issues/<path-to-issue>/plan.md
```
{{else}}

**End with:** The verbatim plan summary directly in the chat, always tell the user the exact command to run:

`/implementing-plans ./issues/<path-to-issue>/plan.md`
{{/if}}
